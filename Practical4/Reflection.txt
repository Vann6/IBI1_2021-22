The overall structure of the Practical4 is clear but I encountered some 
problems. First, I had trouble in installing the Git. Second, some steps 
make me confused, because I don't know the exact meanings. Third, connection to 
Github wasn't always stable.
By asking questions and searching online, I think I can use Git fluently.
